	"content": "VPC Endpoint Introduction A VPC endpoint enables customers to privately connect to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink. Traffic between an Amazon VPC and a service does not leave the Amazon network.\nVPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available Amazon VPC components that allow communication between instances in an Amazon VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on network traffic.\n1. Interface endpoints Interface endpoints enable connectivity to services over AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS managed services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own Amazon VPCs (referred to as endpoint services), and supported AWS Marketplace partner services.\nAn interface endpoint is a collection of one or more elastic network interfaces with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic directed towards a supported service.\nAs VPC interface endpoints utilize PrivateLink, you\u0026rsquo;ll be charged for those endpoints by the hour and by the introduced data transfer.\n2. Gateway endpoints A gateway endpoint targets specific IP routes in an Amazon VPC route table, in the form of a prefix-list, used for traffic destined to Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).\nGateway endpoints do not enable AWS PrivateLink. Gateway endpoints don\u0026rsquo;t introduce any additional costs.\nExample: The application resides in a private subnet and only requires access to Amazon S3. In this situation, we can use a VPC endpoint to maintain the application\u0026rsquo;s strict privacy while still granting it access to our files in S3. This eliminates the need for a NAT gateway in a public subnet and also removes the necessity to redirect traffic through the internet gateway.\nDifferences between 2 endpoint services Instances in an Amazon VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with VPC endpoints, as interface endpoints use local IP addresses within the consumer Amazon VPC.\nGateway endpoints are destinations that are reachable from within an Amazon VPC through prefix-lists within the Amazon VPC’s route table.\nConnectivity to AWS services using VPC endpoints Comparision Benefits of VPC Endpoints 1. Potentially Lower Latency Routing traffic through the public internet introduces the possibility of increased latency. However, if all traffics remain within the AWS network, the latency can be reduced.\n2. Reduced Data Fees If you rely on a managed NAT Gateway, AWS charges data processing fees for egress traffic. This cost can be particularly significant when dealing with vast amounts of data, like at Amazon S3.\n3. Less Attacking Surface and Security Risks When accessing your customer\u0026rsquo;s data stored in DynamoDB from within your application, it is of utmost importance to ensure that the traffic remains within the AWS network. Allowing the data to leave the AWS network poses a significant security risk that could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the information.\n4. Enhanced Compliance and Governance Depending on your industry or regulatory requirements, using public internet routing may not meet compliance standards. VPC endpoints offer a more controlled and compliant environment for accessing AWS services.\n"

	"content": "AWS PrivateLink Introduction AWS PrivateLink provides secure, private connectivity between Amazon VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications on the AWS network.\nAWS PrivateLink also allows customers to create an application in their Amazon VPC, referred to as a service provider VPC, and offers that application as an AWS PrivateLink-enabled service or VPC endpoint service. A VPC endpoint service lets customers host a service and have it accessed by other consumers using AWS PrivateLink.\nPrior to the availability of AWS PrivateLink, services residing in a single Amazon VPC were connected to multiple Amazon VPCs either:\nThrough public IP addresses using each VPC’s internet gateway By private IP addresses using VPC peering. With AWS PrivateLink, service connectivity over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) can be established from the service provider’s VPC to the service consumers’ VPCs in a secure and scalable manner.\nAWS PrivateLink provides the following three main benefits:\nUse private IP addresses for traffic: Provides Amazon VPCs with a secure and scalable way to privately connect to AWS-hosted services. Traffic does not use public internet protocols (IP) addresses. Uses private IP addresses and security groups within an Amazon VPC so that services function as though they were hosted directly within an Amazon VPC. Simplify network management: Avoid both security policies that limit benefits of internet gateways and complex networking across a large number of Amazon VPCs. Allows for connectivity to services across different accounts and Amazon VPCs with no need for route table modifications. Facilitate your cloud migration Gives on-premises networks private access to AWS services via AWS Direct Connect. How does AWS PrivateLink work? AWS PrivateLink uses Network Load Balancers to connect interface endpoints to services. A Network Load Balancer functions at the network transport layer (layer 4) and can handle millions of requests per second. In the case of AWS PrivateLink, it is represented inside the consumer Amazon VPC as an endpoint network interface.\nCustomers can specify multiple subnets in different Availability Zones to ensure that their service is resilient to an Availability Zone service disruption. To achieve this, they can create endpoint network interfaces in multiple subnets mapping to multiple Availability Zones.\nAn endpoint network interface can be viewed in the account, but customers cannot manage it themselves.\n"

These instances reside within private subnets across two distinct Availability Zones. To equip both EC2 instances with necessary packages and libraries, they require public internet access. Hence, we\u0026rsquo;ll incorporate a NAT Gateway along with an entry to this gateway within the private route table.\nOur NAT Gateway has been established within the same public subnet as the bastion host — an EC2 instance utilized for validating the functionality of our service providers. To ensure smooth execution of our tests later on, we\u0026rsquo;ve configured appropriate Ingress rules within the security groups for both the private and public EC2 instances. Specifically, the security group for the private subnet allows traffic from within the VPC CIDR block to access port 80. Meanwhile, the security group for the public EC2 instance facilitates SSH access by opening port 22, enabling us to connect to the bastion host.\n1.
